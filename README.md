# Portfolio Website Project

This project brings my original portfolio website design to life. The initial concept was created using **Affinity Designer 2**, where I focused on layout, visual hierarchy, and branding.

To transform the static design into a functional web experience, I built the site using **React**, translating the visual mockup into an interactive, real-world application. This repository showcases the full implementation of that designâ€”from concept to code.
